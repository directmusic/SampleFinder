# SampleFinder
<img src="/readme/screenshot.png">
SampleFinder is a simple sample browser made to replace Logic Pro's built in file browser. It's quite rough around the edges but it is functional for my personal purposes. Perhaps you might find it useful as well.

The advantages over logic's browser:

* Searches for 2+ words searches for files with both of the words rather than their exact string.
* Searches also look at folder name. (For example: A folder of kicks nameed `kicks` with files named `01.wav, 02.wav, etc...` will show instead of being ignored).
* Favorites are far more accessible.
* Samples play on hover for quick previewing.

# Get Started

First, edit the settings.json file to include your favorites and the directories you'd like SampleFinder to search.

Run the following commands:

```
npm i
npm start
```
